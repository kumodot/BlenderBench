# MS Blender Add-ons Repository

This is my first Blender Add-ons repository.

I am a Senior 3D Artist with over 30 years of experience, and I started learning Blender in 2025 as a sidekick tool for my daily work — mainly for modeling, UVing, and 3D printing support.

As an advanced 3ds Max user, my add-ons are focused on replicating and adapting some of my personal workflows from other DCCs, aiming for speed, simplicity, and consistency.

All my Add-ons use the prefix **MS** (Marcelo Souza) for easier organization and recognition.

## 🧩 Available Add-ons

### [MS_3DPrintAid](./MS_3DPrintAid)
A helper tool for preparing Blender scenes for 3D printing.  
It sets the scene scale to millimeters, adjusts viewport grid to 1cm, adds a “safe build plate” visualization, corner labels, and includes a quick STL export cycling function.

### [MS_ColorAid](./MS_ColorAid)
A utility to manage and preview object colors in the viewport for fast visual organization — ideal for modeling and layout workflows.

### [MS_PivotAid](./MS_PivotAid)
A small but powerful tool to align, center, or transfer object pivots quickly, mimicking some of the 3ds Max pivot controls.

## 🧠 Notes

These add-ons are created mainly for personal use and learning purposes, but feel free to test them, suggest improvements, or report issues.  
I will update and polish them over time as I integrate Blender more into my daily workflow.
