# MS Blender Add-ons Repository

This is my first Blender Add-ons repository.

I am a Senior 3D Artist with over 30 years of experience, and I started learning Blender in 2025 as a sidekick tool for my daily work ‚Äî mainly for modeling, UVing, and 3D printing support.

As an advanced 3ds Max user, my add-ons are focused on replicating and adapting some of my personal workflows from other DCCs, aiming for speed, simplicity, and consistency.

All my Add-ons use the prefix **MS** (Marcelo Souza) for easier organization and recognition.

## üß© Available Add-ons

### [MS_3DPrintAid](./MS_3DPrintAid)

A helper tool for preparing Blender scenes for 3D printing.  
It sets the scene scale to millimeters, adjusts viewport grid to 1cm, adds a ‚Äúsafe build plate‚Äù visualization, corner labels, and includes a quick STL export cycling function.

  >>> The Export button will export the selected object as an STL file using the following naming sequence:
- 3dpart_bld_01.stl
- 3dpart_bld_02.stl
- 3dpart_bld_03.stl
      The files are saved in the root of your D:\ drive.

If you want to change the naming pattern or the save location, you can modify the Python code manually before installing the Blender Add-on.

The files will always overwrite themselves following this cycle. So, after exporting 3dpart_bld_03.stl, the next export will return to 3dpart_bld_01.stl, and so on. These are intended as temporary files, so if you wish to keep them, simply move or rename them after export.

### [MS_ColorAid](./MS_ColorAid)

A utility to manage and preview object colors in the viewport for fast visual organization ‚Äî ideal for modeling and layout workflows.
