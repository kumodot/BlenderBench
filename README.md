# MS Blender Add-ons Repository

This is my first Blender Add-ons repository.

I am a Senior 3D Artist with over 30 years of experience, and I started learning Blender in 2025 as a sidekick tool for my daily work ‚Äî mainly for modeling, UVing, and 3D printing support.

As an advanced 3ds Max user, my add-ons are focused on replicating and adapting some of my personal workflows from other DCCs, aiming for speed, simplicity, and consistency.

All my Add-ons use the prefix **MS** (Marcelo Souza) for easier organization and recognition.
